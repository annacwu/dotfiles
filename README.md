# Linux dotfiles repo

## Alacritty:
- terminal of choice for customization
- small issue with sshing

## neovim:
- text editor of choice
- many custom and potentially strange keybind choices for movement and modes

## i3:
- window manager of choice

## polybar:
- status bar of choice to work with i3
- missing one of the files for it because it goes in /etc
